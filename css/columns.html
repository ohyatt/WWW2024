    <h1> Here is lyrics of the song that you are hearing now!</h1>
    <div class="lyrics">
       <h2>Lil Uzi Vert - 20min</h2>
        I said girl why you keep callin'?
        I said girl why you keep callin'? (Yeah)
        She said I need a new whip
        Yeah, 'cause I know that you still ballin'
        She just wanna go back to the future, so I brought that girl a DeLorean
        Twenty-one minutes until I gotta go
        So I told that girl that I'm gonna slaughter it
        I met that girl right up at my show
        Left her man in the crowd on the floor
        Out of town never saw her before
        Told her, "Baby, we don't got that long"
        Listen, this not my city show
        But I treat it like my city show
        Twenty more minutes until I'm on
        Twenty more minutes until I'm on (yeah)
        Twenty more minutes until I'm on
        Twenty more minutes until I'm on
        Twenty more minutes until I'm on
        Twenty more minutes until I'm on
        Yeah, I am not slow
        These girls just want me 'cause I got the dough
        Pass that girl right on my friend, give and go (what?)
        He pass me her friend, so they switchin' roles (yeah)
        I hit it fast (fast), yeah, I hit it slow (slow)
        Back by the mornin' girl, I gotta go
        Gotta get ready, tonight is my show
        If you okay, you might open my show
        Got the big pointers right under my nose
        These niggas mad 'cause I got all the dough
        These niggas mad 'cause I got all the dough (yeah)
        Changin' my style 'cause I got every flow
        Got every girl, ain't no toppin' my hoes (yeah)
        I understand that is your girlfriend, bro
        But you know I gotta keep her close
        Open your legs and I keep 'em closed
        Livin' life on the edge, on a tightrope (rope)
        I am so clean, I might start movin' soap (yeah)
        Drive a new 'Rari, I don't need a note (skrr)
        Drive a Bugatti like it's a Volvo
        I got your girl and you already know
        Don't really like her, we friends for the most
        Cuban link tri-color, all on my choker (yeah)
        Don't leave the crumb, got the bread, then you toast
        If you start touchin' my gun, got no holst'
        I put a coat on top of my coat
        Only twenty minutes before the show
        I met that girl right up at my show
        Left her man in the crowd on the floor
        Out of town, never saw her before
        Told her, "Baby, we don't got that long"
        Listen, this not my city show
        But I treat it like my city show
        Twenty more minutes until I'm on
        Twenty more minutes until I'm on
        Twenty more minutes until I'm on
        Twenty more minutes until I'm on
        Twenty more minutes until I'm on (yeah)
        Twenty more minutes until I'm on
        Yeah, I am not slow
